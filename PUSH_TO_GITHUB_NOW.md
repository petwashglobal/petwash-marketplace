# 🚀 Push Your Code to GitHub - 2 Simple Clicks!

## ✅ Everything is Ready!

I've already done all the hard work:
- ✅ Created your GitHub repository
- ✅ Connected Replit to GitHub
- ✅ Written beautiful README
- ✅ Prepared all your code

**You just need to click 2 buttons!**

---

## 📋 Step 1: Open Git Panel

Look at the **LEFT sidebar** in Replit. You'll see several icons stacked vertically.

Find and click the **Git/Version Control icon** - it looks like a branch (🌿) or tree.

**Where to find it:**
```
📁 Files         ← Not this
🔍 Search        ← Not this
🌿 Git/Version   ← CLICK THIS ONE! 
🔧 Tools         ← Not this
```

## 📋 Step 2: Push Your Code

After clicking the Git icon, you'll see a panel open on the left.

You'll see:
- A list of files that changed
- A text box that might say "Commit message"
- A button that says **"Push"** or **"Commit & Push"**

**Click the "Push" button!**

That's it! Your code will upload to GitHub in 5-10 seconds.

## ✅ Verify It Worked

After pushing, open this link:
**https://github.com/petwashglobal/petwash-marketplace**

You should see:
- ✅ README.md with Pet Wash description
- ✅ All your folders (client, server, shared, etc.)
- ✅ All your luxury marketplace code!

## 🎯 After GitHub Push

Once your code is on GitHub, you can:

**Deploy Your Live Website:**
1. Click the **"Publish"** button in Replit (top right)
2. Choose "Autoscale Deployment"
3. Your site will go live at `petwash.replit.app`
4. Then connect your custom domain `petwash.co.il`
