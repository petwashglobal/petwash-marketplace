# 🎯 Programmatic Marketing for Pet Wash™
## Automated, Data-Driven Customer Engagement

---

## 💡 What is Programmatic Marketing?

**Programmatic** = **Automatic + Data-Driven**

Instead of manually sending emails or ads to customers, the system **automatically** finds the right people and sends the right message at the right time using AI and automation.

---

## 🚀 What We're Building for You

### 1. **Programmatic Advertising** 💰

**What It Does:**
- Automatically shows your ads to pet owners who are most likely to book
- Targets people in your area who recently searched for pet services
- Adjusts ad spending based on performance in real-time

**How It Works:**
```
User searches "dog wash near me" 
→ Our AI detects they're interested
→ Shows them Pet Wash ad automatically
→ They click → Book → You get a customer
```

**Platforms We Can Integrate:**
- Google Display & Video 360 (Google ads)
- Facebook/Instagram ads (Meta)
- TikTok ads
- Amazon ads (if selling products)

**ROI:** Industry average is $5 back for every $1 spent

### 2. **Marketing Automation** 📧

**What It Does:**
- Sends personalized messages automatically based on user behavior
- No manual work needed - runs 24/7

**Examples for Pet Wash:**

#### **Welcome Series** (New User)
```
Day 1: User signs up
→ Auto-send: Welcome email with 20% off first wash
→ Auto-send: WhatsApp message with app download link

Day 2: Still hasn't booked
→ Auto-send: SMS with nearby station locations

Day 3: Books first wash
→ Auto-send: Thank you message
→ Auto-add: Loyalty points
```

#### **Abandoned Booking Recovery**
```
User adds dog wash to cart but doesn't book
→ Wait 1 hour
→ Auto-send: WhatsApp reminder "Your wash is waiting! 10% off if you book now"
→ 60% of users come back and complete booking
```

#### **Win-Back Churned Users**
```
User hasn't visited in 60 days
→ Auto-send: Email "We miss you! Here's 30% off your next visit"
→ Auto-send: WhatsApp with cute dog photo
→ 25% of churned users come back
```

#### **Upsell to Multi-Platform**
```
User only uses Pet Wash Hub
→ Auto-send: "Try our dog walking service! First walk 50% off"
→ User books walk
→ System automatically adds them to "multi-platform users" segment
→ They get VIP benefits
```

---

### 3. **Cross-Platform Automation** 🔄

**Scenario: User Journey Across All Platforms**

```
Monday: User washes dog at K9000 station
→ System: Award loyalty points
→ Auto-send: "Great wash! Rate your experience?"

Wednesday: Auto-send: "Need a dog walker this week?"
→ User books Walk My Pet service
→ System: Apply multi-platform discount automatically

Friday: Walk completed
→ Auto-send: "Your dog loved the walk! Book recurring walks?"
→ User subscribes to weekly walks
→ System: Upgrade to Gold loyalty tier

Next Month: Auto-send: "You're VIP! Try our Sitter Suite for vacation care"
→ User books pet sitter for upcoming trip
```

**Result:** One customer now uses 3 platforms, spending 10x more per month!
