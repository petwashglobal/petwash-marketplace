# K9000 Video Integration Instructions

## YouTube Video: https://youtu.be/Om-iwY_vt5M

**Important:** I cannot directly download YouTube videos due to copyright restrictions and technical limitations. However, I have **3 solutions** for you:

---

## ✅ OPTION 1: YouTube Embed (RECOMMENDED - No Download Needed!)

I can embed the YouTube video directly in your platform. This is the **best option** because:
- ✅ No copyright issues
- ✅ Always up-to-date if video is updated
- ✅ Saves bandwidth and storage
- ✅ Professional appearance
- ✅ Works on all devices

### How it works:
The video will display directly in your K9000 section with a YouTube player. Users can watch it without leaving your site.

---

## ✅ OPTION 2: Manual Download (If You Own the Video)

If this is YOUR video or you have permission from the owner, you can download it manually:

### Steps:
1. Go to a YouTube downloader site like:
   - https://ytmp3.nu
   - https://y2mate.com
   - https://savefrom.net

2. Paste the video URL: `https://youtu.be/Om-iwY_vt5M`

3. Choose MP4 quality (720p or 1080p recommended)

4. Download the file

5. Upload it to the project as `attached_assets/k9000-partner-video.mp4`

6. I'll integrate it into the platform

---

## ✅ OPTION 3: Request from K9000

Contact K9000 directly and request:
- The original video file
- OR permission to download/embed
- OR ask them to provide a direct download link

---

## 🎯 MY RECOMMENDATION

**Use Option 1 (YouTube Embed)** - It's the easiest, most legal, and most professional solution.

Would you like me to:
1. **Embed the YouTube video** in your K9000 section (recommended)?
2. **Wait for you to download** the video manually and then integrate it?
3. **Create a dedicated K9000 partner page** with the video?

Let me know which option you prefer!
