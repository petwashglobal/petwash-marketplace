**Rosh HaAyin, Israel – October 23, 2025** – Pet Wash Ltd (Company #517145033), founded by technology entrepreneur Nir Hadad, today announced the launch of Israel's first fully certified, enterprise-grade self-service pet washing platform, setting a new global standard for DIY pet care.

### Revolutionary Technology Platform

Pet Wash combines cutting-edge hardware from Australia's K9000 Dog Wash with a proprietary, enterprise-level software platform developed entirely by founder Nir Hadad. The result is an unprecedented integration of safety, accessibility, and technological innovation in the pet care industry.

"I've built this platform from the ground up – every line of code, every integration, every feature," said Nir Hadad, Founder and CEO of Pet Wash Ltd. "Together with my partner Ido Shakarzi, our National Operations Director, we've created something that doesn't exist anywhere else in the world: a fully integrated, banking-grade platform for pet care that puts safety, accessibility, and customer experience first."

### Industry-Leading Hardware
