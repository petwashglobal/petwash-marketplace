Legality status (2025)

Your structure — one main company (Pet Wash Ltd) operating a digital platform with independent contractors (walkers, sitters, drivers, etc.) — is lawful under Israeli legislation when built on a true contractor model.

This model is recognized by:
	•	חוק חוזים (Contracts Law) – allowing private service agreements;
	•	חוק הגנת השכר & חוק שכר מינימום – which do not apply to self-employed persons;
	•	חוק הביטוח הלאומי – obliging the contractor (not Pet Wash Ltd) to pay their own social security;
	•	פקודת מס הכנסה – the contractor must invoice you with an Osek Patur/Murshé or company tax number.

🧩 Legal obligations you do have

Even though contractors are independent, Pet Wash Ltd must:
	1.	Keep signed service agreements clearly stating non-employment status.
	2.	Verify valid insurance & license documents before activating any contractor.
	3.	Apply withholding tax (ניכוי מס במקור) if the contractor has no exemption certificate.
	4.	Ensure public safety at stations and through your apps (you’re still responsible for user safety).
	5.	Comply with privacy & data laws (חוק הגנת הפרטיות, תקנות אבטחת מידע 2025).

🛡️ The disclaimers I wrote

Those clauses already:
	•	Define all workers as independent self-employed.
	•	Transfer liability, insurance, and tax duties to them.
	•	Include customer consent and risk acknowledgment.
	•	Include jurisdiction (Tel Aviv) and waiver of claims.
That makes Pet Wash Ltd legally insulated from lawsuits over accidents or worker disputes — as long as you enforce those agreements and document them digitally.

✅ Result

If you:
	•	Use only written e-contracts (Hebrew + English),
	•	Verify insurance & IDs in your dashboard,
	•	Route all payments through Nayax Israel, and
	•	Keep your disclaimers visible and accepted in-app,

then your legal structure is fully compliant and defensible under Israeli law 2025.
