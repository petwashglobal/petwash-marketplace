🚀 The 2025 Pet Marketplace Architecture: Open Flow Edition
The system is built on four interconnected layers: Mobile Apps, Real-Time Layer, Backend Logic, and Financial Management.
I. 📱 Mobile Apps (User & Sitter/Driver)
The best code for 2025 mobile applications focuses entirely on declarative UI frameworks for performance, maintainability, and fast development cycles.
• User/Client App: Built using SwiftUI for iOS and Jetpack Compose for Android. This app focuses on seamless booking, high-precision map tracking, and transparent Sitter profile viewing.
• Sitter/Driver App: Also built using SwiftUI for iOS and Jetpack Compose for Android. The key difference lies in the functionality: this app handles real-time Status Toggles (Online/Offline), instant Job Dispatch alerts, and the Earning Dashboard view.
II. 🧠 Backend Logic & Data Flow (The System Brain)
The backend must be a Microservices Architecture using high-performance languages.
• API & Core Logic: The system uses Node.js (NestJS) or Python (FastAPI). These frameworks are chosen for their speed in handling high-volume I/O operations (like constant GPS pings).
• Database: PostgreSQL with the PostGIS extension is the mandatory best practice for 2025. It provides transactional safety for accounting records and ultra-fast geospatial search capabilities needed to find the nearest Sitter efficiently.
• Payments & Accounting: The entire financial flow relies on Stripe Connect. This service handles the secure collection from the User, automatically deducts the platform's commission, and transfers the net amount to the Sitter/Driver's account. This system automatically provides necessary tax documentation (like 1099 forms).
III. 💻 CORE CODE CONCEPTS: Open & Transparent Logic
The core "best code" is defined by how transparently and effectively it handles location, matching, and money.
1. Pet Transport (Uber Model) - Real-Time Code
The system uses WebSockets (Socket.io) as the dedicated layer for instantaneous, low-latency communication.
A. Sitter/Driver Location Reporting (Kotlin Concept):
The Android (Kotlin) app utilizes a background service to constantly stream GPS data when a job is active, ensuring the User sees the live, open-air location of their pet's transport.
