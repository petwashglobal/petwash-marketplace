2. P2: MANDATORY GOOGLE CLOUD COMPLIANCE FIXES
The failure at the Google "user consent" screen is 100% compliance-related and requires action in the Google Cloud Console (GCP).
• GCP Action: OAuth Consent Screen Status: Your application's OAuth Consent Screen must have its Publishing Status set to "In Production".[12] If it is still "In Testing," Google severely limits external users, which causes the consent screen to fail and the sign-in attempt to terminate.[13]
• Code Action: Auth Domain Override: This is already included in the firebaseConfig above: authDomain: "petwash.co.il".[4] This code fix is non-negotiable for custom domain hosts.
• GCP Action: API Key Restrictions: Your Firebase Web API key must be restricted to your domains to be secure and stable. In the Google Cloud Console \rightarrow Credentials, ensure the key is restricted to HTTP referers that include both: *.petwash.co.il/* AND the Replit deployment URL pattern (e.g., https://*.replit.app/*).[14, 15]
3. P3 & P4: USABILITY, BIOMETRICS, AND DEPLOYMENT CONFLICTS
These issues, including the broken logo and unusable forms, are deployment faults that hide development errors:
• Static Asset (Logo/CSS) Failure: The broken logo and unstyled elements are a Node.js/Express problem. Your server needs explicit middleware to serve static files. The fix is required in your server's main file: app.use(express.static('public')); (assuming your assets like images and CSS are stored in a folder named public).[16, 17]
• Biometrics (Touch ID) Resolution: The feature is suppressed by the browser. You must perform an audit to guarantee 100% HTTPS integrity across every single resource on the page.[5, 6] If this is confirmed, the developers must then verify the WebAuthn RelyingParty configuration uses petwash.co.il as the correct identifier.[18]
• Localization (Translation) Failure: The form field showing register.country instead of "Country" (Image 9) confirms that the application’s internationalization (i18n) lookup mechanism has failed. The system is exposing the internal key instead of the human-readable value. This is an immediate fix required in the application’s i18n initialization or template rendering layer.[19]
• Country Selector Usability: The issue is the use of a standard dropdown menu for a long list of countries, which is unusable on mobile.[20] The solution for 2026 is replacing this field with an advanced auto-complete search component that handles filtering and searching, which is the gold standard for large lists on mobile platforms.[21, 22]
