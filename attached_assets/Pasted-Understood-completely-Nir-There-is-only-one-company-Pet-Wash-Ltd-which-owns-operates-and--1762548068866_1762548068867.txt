Understood completely, Nir.
✅ There is only one company — Pet Wash™ Ltd — which owns, operates, and manages all platforms, brands, and activities worldwide.
No subsidiaries or external entities will ever be mentioned or invented. Every system, brand, app, and payment flow must always sit under Pet Wash™ Ltd as the single corporate head.

Here’s the corrected and final smart global management logic plan, reflecting that structure truthfully and keeping every operation, employee, and platform tied to Pet Wash™ Ltd — legally, technically, and financially.

PET WASH™ LTD – 2025 SMART GLOBAL MANAGEMENT MASTER PLAN

Head company: Pet Wash™ Ltd
Registered jurisdiction: Israel
Global operational coverage: All current and future territories operate directly under Pet Wash™ Ltd with no subsidiaries.
Core principle: One company, one legal entity, one ledger, one trust system, one payment gateway (Nayax Israel).

⸻

1. STRUCTURE AND CONTROL
Pet Wash™ Ltd owns and operates all platforms:
Pet Wash Hub™, Walk My Pet™, The Sitter Suite™, PetTrek™, Paw Finder™, The Plush Lab™, K9000 Cloud™, and Enterprise Solutions.
All share one unified codebase, one global database, one payments and accounting system, and one compliance framework.

All brand data and operations are managed through the Pet Wash™ Global Operations Hub, the single command center used by management, finance, legal, and support teams.

⸻

2. PAYMENTS AND BANKING
All transactions from every platform flow exclusively through Nayax Israel, which acts as the single payment processor and acquirer for Pet Wash™ Ltd.
No other processors or merchant accounts are used.

Payments from users are authorized, captured, and reconciled directly to the Pet Wash™ Ltd merchant account.
Refunds, chargebacks, and payouts are handled inside the same ledger with full legal traceability.
Every transaction links a Nayax transaction ID with an internal ledger ID, enabling zero-error reconciliation.

All invoices, receipts, and tax reporting originate from Pet Wash™ Ltd under its Israeli registration number and VAT obligations.
When the company operates services in other countries, it does so as a foreign-registered business under the same parent name, never as a new entity.

⸻

3. TAX, LEGAL, AND ACCOUNTING
The accounting system, ledger, and tax engine all belong to Pet Wash™ Ltd.
All taxes (VAT / מע״מ) are filed through the Israeli Tax Authority (Misrad HaMisim).
For cross-border transactions, the system calculates local VAT or GST but reports them centrally through the Pet Wash™ Ltd accounts department.

Bookkeeping follows IFRS 15 and Israeli corporate law.
Every booking and payment is recorded instantly and backed up daily.
Invoices are sequential, digitally signed, and stored for seven years as required by Israeli regulation.

⸻

4. EMPLOYEES AND PROVIDERS
Every employee, contractor, and service provider worldwide works directly under Pet Wash™ Ltd.
Each profile in the admin system carries a verified KYC record, signed agreement, and tax status (employee / independent contractor).
Payroll, commissions, and bonuses are issued from the same ledger through Nayax Israel or approved bank transfers from Pet Wash™ Ltd’s corporate account.

All hours, trips, and tasks are tracked automatically using GPS and Waze integration, generating auditable logs for salary and expense reimbursement.

⸻

5. PLATFORM AND BACK-END LOGIC
Every digital service connects to one Payments & Ledger microservice and one User Identity service.
Modules (wash, walk, sit, train, transport, gift, IoT, enterprise) run independently for stability but share the same database cluster and API gateway.
This guarantees consistent data and full compliance.

Each service creates real-time events—bookings, authorizations, captures, invoices, and receipts—all stored under the same Pet Wash™ Ltd ledger.
Nothing can be modified without a time-stamped audit entry.

⸻

6. ADMIN STATION ID & WAZE INTEGRATION
Every wash station, mobile unit, or driver is assigned a permanent Station ID registered to Pet Wash™ Ltd.
That ID stores: address, GPS coordinates, maintenance history, and assigned employee.

The system integrates directly with Waze and Google Maps APIs.
For each job, the backend generates a Waze link to the destination so drivers and users can navigate instantly.
All routes, ETAs, and mileage are recorded and linked to the job record for analytics and expense reporting.

⸻

7. OPERATIONS DASHBOARD
All departments log into one admin portal:
Operations | Finance | Trust & Safety | IoT Monitoring | Customer Support.
Every admin action is recorded under the Pet Wash™ Ltd audit ledger.
Data is segmented by module for clarity but governed under one authority.

⸻

8. SMART INVOICES AND RECORDS
When a transaction completes, the system issues:
• A customer receipt showing Pet Wash™ Ltd as the seller.
• A digital invoice with VAT number and Nayax reference.
• A provider statement if applicable.
All documents are stored automatically and retrievable anytime.
The finance team exports summarized journals daily to the accounting platform and locks the data after reconciliation.

⸻

9. COST CONTROL AND TAX EFFICIENCY
Expense submissions, fuel logs, and maintenance costs are processed through one ledger.
AI categorizes deductible expenses and flags personal or non-deductible ones before submission, helping save tax legally.
Vehicle mileage captured through Waze generates automatic expense claims, linked to each driver’s profile for accurate deduction.

All service providers outside payroll operate as verified independent contractors, minimizing employer tax while staying fully compliant with Israeli law.

⸻

10. COMPLIANCE AND AUDIT INTEGRITY
Pet Wash™ Ltd follows:
– Israeli Corporate Law and VAT Regulations
– GDPR and Israeli Privacy Protection Law
– PCI DSS standards (inherited from Nayax Israel)
– ISO 27001 data security controls.

All databases are encrypted at rest and backed up daily in two regions.
Immutable logs protect the company legally; every invoice, refund, and admin change carries a cryptographic hash for proof of integrity.

⸻

11. GLOBAL OPERATIONS UNDER ONE LEGAL ENTITY
When Pet Wash™ Ltd provides services abroad, it registers locally as a foreign company branch, keeping the same brand, ledger, and payment infrastructure.
All profits and taxes flow transparently to the main Israeli entity.
This ensures uniform compliance, clear financial control, and lower administrative overhead.

⸻

12. WAZE AND LOCATION INTELLIGENCE
Waze data feeds live into the analytics engine.
The system learns driving times, station congestion, and regional demand to optimize scheduling and station placement.
Managers see on the admin map which stations are busy or idle in real time.

⸻

13. FUTURE-PROOF LOGIC
AI modules monitor trends and predict revenue, maintenance needs, and energy use.
Predictive analytics help adjust marketing and pricing to each city while keeping all accounting under Pet Wash™ Ltd’s legal and tax structure.
All new platforms or partnerships plug directly into the same wallet, ledger, and trust layers—no duplicates, no new entities.

⸻

14. STRATEGIC SUMMARY
Everything—software, hardware, employees, payments, invoices, data, and tax—belongs entirely to Pet Wash™ Ltd.
All operations worldwide run through one gateway (Nayax Israel), one ledger, and one compliance framework.
Every action is time-stamped, traceable, legally correct, and optimized for efficiency, security, and minimal tax exposure.
The result is a single global company with zero confusion, zero risk, and maximum operational intelligence.

⸻

This is the final and factual structure — one company, Pet Wash™ Ltd, legally and operationally the head of all platforms, managing everything worldwide with full trust, verified payments, and absolute compliance.
