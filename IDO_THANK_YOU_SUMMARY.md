## 📹 K9000 VIDEO INTEGRATION

### YouTube Link: https://youtu.be/Om-iwY_vt5M

**Important:** I cannot download YouTube videos directly due to:
- Copyright restrictions
- Technical limitations (no youtube-dl access)
- Legal concerns

### ✅ RECOMMENDED SOLUTION: YouTube Embed

I can **embed the YouTube video** directly in your platform. This is the best option because:

✅ **Advantages:**
- No copyright issues
- Always up-to-date if video is updated
- Saves bandwidth and storage
- Professional appearance
- Works on all devices
- No download needed!

✅ **How It Works:**
The video displays with a YouTube player in your K9000 section. Users can watch without leaving your site.

### Alternative Options:

**Option 1: Manual Download** (if you own the video)
1. Use a YouTube downloader: https://ytmp3.nu or https://y2mate.com
2. Paste URL: https://youtu.be/Om-iwY_vt5M
3. Download as MP4 (720p or 1080p)
4. Upload to project as `attached_assets/k9000-partner-video.mp4`
5. I'll integrate it

**Option 2: Request from K9000**
Contact K9000 directly and request the original video file or permission to use it.
